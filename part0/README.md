Part 0 

Since exercises in part 0 of the course mostly contain reading material, I've included markdown files for the diagram exercises. You can copy/paste the contents from the markdown files into here https://www.websequencediagrams.com/ and you should see the diagram.

Since exercises 5 and 6 create diagrams for the same URL with just one minor difference, I've combined both of them into exercise-0.5.md.
